# Insight-Analysis-for-CSV-File-using-Data-Structures-and-Python

Python terminal based simple application which is a composition of both Data Structures using Python and Statistical analysis processed and stored efficiently after analysis of a whole CSV file.
What happens is the user uploads the csv file, navigates thorugh the menu driven program and finds out his results from statistical analysis available over the program. A simple report of the analysis will then be generated as a text file in the name of the csv file which could be found in the applications folder.

EXCEPTION
  Analysis and visualtions for big datasets wont be as accurate as generated independently.
